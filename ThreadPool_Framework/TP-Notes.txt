=> ThreadPool :- ThreadPool represents a group of worker threads that are waiting for the job and can be reused many times


-> "ThreadPool framework" is also known as "Executor framework"
-> ThreadPool was introduced in JDK 1.5 version

-> Advantage : It saves a lot of time in creating threads and providing jobs to them which leads to the better performance of our application

-> ThreadPool is already implemented in Servlet & JSP containers which each request is processed by thread which comes from thread-pool

-> ThreadPool framework contains following classes and interfaces :-
1. Executors (class) (important)
2. ExecutorService (interface) (important)
3. Executor (interface)
4. ExecutorCompletionService (class)

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

=> Executors class :- Executors class provides factory and utility methods for ExecutorService, 
Executor, ThreadFactory, ScheduledExecutor Service & Callable.

-> Methods of Executors class :
    1. Executors.newFixedThreadPool(int no_of_threads)
    2. Executors.newSingleThreadExecutor()
    3. Executors.newCachedThreadPool()
    4. Executors.newScheduledThreadPool()
    5. Executors.newSingleThreadScheduledExecutor()

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


=> ExecutorService interface :- ExecutorService interface allows us to execute the thread task asynchronously.

-> ExecutorService helps in maintaining a pool of threads and assign them tasks. It also provides the facility 
to queue up the tasks until there is any free thread available.

-> ExecutorService defines the methods that executes the threads and returns some results.


-> Methods of ExecutorService interface :-
	 Below methods will assign the task to ExecutorService :-
		1. execute(Runnable r)
		2. submit(Runnable/Callable r)
		3. invokeAny(Collection c)
		4. invokeAll(Collection c)
	 Below method is used for shutdown the ExecutorService :-
		5. shutdown()
		6. shutdownNow()

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


=> ThreadPool have some risks which are as follows :-
1. Deadlock
2. Thread interference
3. Thread leakage : This risk can occur if any thread removed from the thread-pool but that 
                    thread didnt returned in the thread-pool
4. Resource thrashing : This risk can occur when there are lot of thread in the thread-pool,
                     then time will be wasted in context-switching between the threads.
